			<p>For a large portion of the 2010s, MLB attendance was on a downward slope. When the league delayed its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, concerns that stadiums may never return to their full capacities only increased. However, MLB is no longer defined by those worries over five years later. Although attendance hasn’t reached the same peaks as it did in the mid-late 2000s, it’s undergone a steady comeback as a result of the league’s economic situation, changes in rules, and focus on the fan experience.</p>

			<h3>This is another subhed</h3>
			<p>Research gives an explanation as to why MLB’s recovery in attendance has been gradual rather than rapid. 
			    In “The Impact of COVID-19 on Fan Attendance To Sports Events: The Case of Major League Baseball,” researcher Alondra Aleman concluded 
				that the effects of COVID had a lasting impact on the behavior of MLB fans. Even after numerous health 
				restrictions were removed, many fans still hesitated to return due to remaining concerns for their health and economic concerns. 
				The research noted that attendance typically drops after significant events like pandemics or recession. 
				This usually lasts for more time in baseball due to larger venues and longer seasons. <p>

				<section>

                <p>Moonsop Hyun, an assistant professor at the University of Louisville and researcher of sports analytics and economics, 
				claimed that the country’s economic status is one of the primary factors in influencing MLB’s attendance. 
				“Attendance dropped sharply in 2009 right after the 2008 financial crisis,” he stated before comparing it to the pandemic. 
				“After COVID in 2020 attendance also did not recover right away. I still think the MLB is in a recovery process.” 
				People willing to return to stadiums had to deal with extra factors like inflation and increased living costs. 
				This made the discretionary spending on baseball tickets less predictable.<p>

				<h2>What Changes Were Made to Increase Ticket Sales?</h2>
				<p> The COVID virus also came at a time when the sport’s popularity was in question. According to Hyun, both attendance and popularity decreased from 2015-2019, and people thought MLB was “experiencing a serious crisis.” Hyun claims that the league’s recovery in attendance must also be partially attributed to the rule changes within the game to address the aforementioned issue. MLB introduced a pitch clock in 2023, which cut average game times down from three hours and eleven minutes in 2021 to just two hours and 40 minutes in 2025. By shortening play, the live experience improved for fans, who had to sit through less dead ball time.

                The pitch clock was just one addition by MLB to prioritize in-person watchability. Bigger bases allowed players to record more steals, and regulations on defensive shifts allowed for more offense, which increased the game’s popularity. While these changes didn’t rapidly increase attendance, they did so at a satisfactory rate for MLB.
                <section>

	           <p> Another reason for MLB’s attendance revival has been credited to the league’s pricing strategies. MLB largely held back from heavily increasing ticket prices after the pandemic, unlike other industries. “MLB has been lowering ticket prices in recent years. … lower ticket prices generally increase attendance” Hyun said. Aleman’s study also corroborates this, claiming that affordability was a key factor in determining whether or not fans felt comfortable returning to ballparks. <p>

	           <section>
	           
	           One key factor that also contributed to the return of fans has been the popularity of star players. Hyun noted that research shows fan turnout increases when a team has a superstar player. Athletes like Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge have drawn league-wide interest, attracting fans from local markets and other cities, increasing attendance at home and road games. 

	           <section>

	           <p> While some people may blame streaming services and other virtual-viewing options for a decline in attendance, research shows they actually have a minimal impact. As Hyun put it “Streaming services are not a major issue because watching MLB still requires subscriptions in many cases. Ticket prices have remained relatively stable.” Although consumption has changed recently, going to a live game still has a special feel for many fans, especially when teams focus on stadium entertainment and other promotional factors. <p>

			<h3>Other Considerations and Final Takeaways</h3>
			<p>Filling every seat isn’t MLB’s only concern. As Hyun put it, “MLB teams also generally do not focus heavily on maximizing attendance. … Their goal is not to maximize attendance but to maximize profit.” He claimed that some MLB teams increase ticket prices even when attendance decreases in order to increase total revenue. This sheds light onto why today’s attendance numbers are often compared to those from the 2000s, and how other factors typically aren’t considered. While the total number of fans at MLB games was higher in 2008 than in 2025, the league’s comeback plan has been centered around the long-term rather than attendance records. <p>
			<section>
	        <p>The recovery from the COVID pandemic has varied from team to team. However, the league’s overall strategy provides a solid economic lesson. MLB’s bounceback wasn’t the result of any single policy or action. It took a combination of factors to revive the popularity of a sport that had dwindled in past years. While the league’s attendance number may not return to their levels from the late 2000s, recent trends show that this isn’t the only way MLB measures its financial success. It has found a balance between fan engagement, economic sustainability, and creating a product that is worth returning to. <p>
